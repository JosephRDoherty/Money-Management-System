Short Term:
Separate my financial data somehow without having to maintain multiple branches or something. Maybe a JSON file that can be maintained somewhere separately?
Clean up the code that is specific to my situation, and make it more usable for everyone
impliment multiple cash flows! This is going to be hard
Create a better desktop screen layout. Right now it is *very* mobile-first.

Long Term:
Rebuild this entire thing in a web framework, maybe Django or Ruby on Rails. NOT ASP.NET, PLEASE
Create user accounts
store user data in a database


Dream Features:
Connect to a bank account, so it can actually monitor what bills have gone through, how much you got paid, and all of the cool things you could do with that information
Automatically transfer funds
automatically pay bills
A *literal* personal accountant, only alerts you when there is a problem that the software can't solve. Otherwise all of your bills are taken care of and hands-off
